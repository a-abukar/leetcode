# Grind 75 Challenge

## Introduction

### What is Grind 75?

Grind 75 (an improved version of Blind 75) is a curated list of 75 coding problems, designed to improve problem-solving and coding proficiency. It is a challenge aimed at mastering key algoritms and data structures commonly used in software development. 

Some of the topics included are:

- Arrays 
- Strings
- Dynamic Programming
- Graph Theory

### My motivation

My motivation is primarily to improve my technical coding and problem-solving ability. As well as this, I aim to improve my coding efficiency, and deepen my understanding of core coding concepts.
